This is a collection of Art of The Macabre, spanning from cinema to manga. It is an ongoing process as the data is quite extensive.


According to legend, Death appears at midnight every year on Halloween. Death calls forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle. His skeletons dance for him until the rooster crows at dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year.
